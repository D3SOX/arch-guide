# Introduction

## Why this guide?
The Arch Wiki has this information spread across multiple pages, and I think this is much more clearly laid out and straight forward.
It also contains some packages and decisions that are personal preference.

## Important other resources

The Arch Wiki is a very powerful resource. If you have any problems it's the first place to search for solutions  
<https://wiki.archlinux.org>

Especially for the installation please read  
<https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide>

Sometimes packages need manual intervention which is announced at  
<https://www.archlinux.org/news/>  
So keep an eye on it or ideally subscribe to the mailing list at  
<https://lists.archlinux.org/listinfo/arch-announce>

This tutorial is inspired by <https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezos/files/ArchStuff/> and have taken out some stuff of it
